In this workshop, you’ll learn how to leverage the Trend Micro Zero Trust Platform to help you connecting your virtual/remote workforce to individual corporate resources, and also your users and devices to the internet, while it implements continuous risk assessment by analyzing threat factors of assets. Access to specific resources can be changed dynamically based on increases or decreases in risk. Trend Micro Vision One™ Risk Insights gathers telemetry and data to automate decisions by leveraging the Trend Micro endpoint agent and network tools.
